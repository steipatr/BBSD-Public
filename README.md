Scenario discovery using time series clustering in R and Python. Created for my MSc thesis "Behavior-Based Scenario Discovery" at TU Delft, which is available at http://repository.tudelft.nl/.

This repository is structured into two folders, representing a simple (budworms) and complex (shale gas) example of time series clustering-based rule induction. Additionally, there is a Functions file for R which contains all the custom functions I developed. Finally, there is a third folder containing deprecated, work in progress and other auxiliary files from my research, which I provide mainly for documentation purposes related to my thesis. This folder also contains a third example, the Brusselator model, which is very similar to the budworms model and therefore is not discussed further.

For each example, a number of RStudio scripts and Jupyter Notebooks are provided. They are numbered in order of analysis and are intended to give an impression of how behavior-based scenario discovery can be conducted. The files also indicate where it is necessary to move data between R and Python, and vice-versa. I am currently developing a more concise examples file to showcase how every developed function can be used.
